An ImageJ plugin that reads results table of spot locations and fit a 2-d
gaussian function to each of the image stack of the spots. 

The plugin calls MP2DGauss.c through Java Native Interface.

Requires to import libraries:

- MPFIT: A MINPACK-1 Least Squares Fitting Library in C
http://www.physics.wisc.edu/~craigm/idl/cmpfit.html

- commons math library http://commons.apache.org/math/

Directory containing Results Tables roughly specifying the centroids of the
spots per image frame should be located as "Input folder".
